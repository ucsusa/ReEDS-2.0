# Renewable energy supply curves
## CSP (concentrated solar thermal power)
The CSP resource classes are defined as follows:
* 1:        CF < 0.23
* 2: 0.23 ≤ CF < 0.26
* 3: 0.26 ≤ CF

Site-level CSP supply curve costs are copied from the site-level supply curve costs for utility-scale photovoltaics (UPV). The mapping code is available on the ReEDS input-processing repo at https://github.nrel.gov/ReEDS/ReEDS-2.0_Input_Processing/tree/main/csp.

### Filtering NULL values
Some files have null values for the `dist_spur_km` column leading to unphysical results. The `filter_null.py` script removes the rows
with NULL spur lengths.
